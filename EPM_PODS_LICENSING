Yes, exactly â€” each **POD** in Oracle Cloud EPM is a **completely isolated environment**, meaning:

> ðŸ”‘ **Each POD can have its own unique set of business processes** â€” including Planning, FCCS, PCM, and more â€” along with their own cubes, metadata, and configurations.

---

### ðŸ§± **What Each POD Can Contain**

Within each POD, you can enable one or more **business processes**, such as:

| Business Process                     | Includes                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning**                         | Custom BSO/ASO cubes, forms, Groovy rules, data maps          |
| **FCCS**                             | Prebuilt financial consolidation cubes, ownership hierarchies |
| **ARCS**                             | Reconciliation data sources, matching rules                   |
| **Narrative Reporting**              | Report packages, doclets, commentary workflows                |
| **PCM (Profitability)**              | Allocation logic, drivers, tracing                            |
| **EDM (Enterprise Data Management)** | Master data model, data governance, mappings                  |

### ðŸ’¡ **Important Notes**

* **Each POD is independent**: You can have completely different applications, dimensions, cubes, and users in each POD.
* **No automatic sharing** of cubes, metadata, or security between PODs.

  * You **can** use tools like **EPM Automate**, **Data Management**, or **Lifecycle Management (LCM)** to **migrate content** between PODs.

### âœ… Summary
