Yes, exactly â€” each **POD** in Oracle Cloud EPM is a **completely isolated environment**, meaning:

> ðŸ”‘ **Each POD can have its own unique set of business processes** â€” including Planning, FCCS, PCM, and more â€” along with their own cubes, metadata, and configurations.

---

### ðŸ§± **What Each POD Can Contain**

Within each POD, you can enable one or more **business processes**, such as:

| Business Process                     | Includes                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning**                         | Custom BSO/ASO cubes, forms, Groovy rules, data maps          |
| **FCCS**                             | Prebuilt financial consolidation cubes, ownership hierarchies |
| **ARCS**                             | Reconciliation data sources, matching rules                   |
| **Narrative Reporting**              | Report packages, doclets, commentary workflows                |
| **PCM (Profitability)**              | Allocation logic, drivers, tracing                            |
| **EDM (Enterprise Data Management)** | Master data model, data governance, mappings                  |

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Important Notes**

* **Each POD is independent**: You can have completely different applications, dimensions, cubes, and users in each POD.
* **No automatic sharing** of cubes, metadata, or security between PODs.

  * You **can** use tools like **EPM Automate**, **Data Management**, or **Lifecycle Management (LCM)** to **migrate content** between PODs.

### ðŸ§­ **Typical Multi-POD Setup Example (Enterprise License)**

| POD Name     | Purpose                         | Enabled Processes                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Prod**     | Live production                 | Planning, FCCS                               |
| **Test**     | User testing + patch validation | Planning (copy of Prod)                      |
| **Dev**      | Development sandbox             | Planning (experimental), Narrative Reporting |
| **Training** | Training & onboarding           | Planning only                                |

---

### ðŸš« With Standard Edition...

* You're limited to **1 POD and 1 business process**, unless you pay extra for each additional POD or process.

---

### âœ… Summary

Each **POD is a fully independent EPM environment** with its own Planning cubes, metadata, and enabled business processes. 
If you're on **Enterprise**, you can spin up **unlimited PODs** for Dev/Test/Training and tailor each one however you like.


NOTE!!

## âœ… **If you use the *Custom Planning* template in Oracle EPM Enterprise:**

You will get:

* **7 required (standard) dimensions**:

  1. Account
  2. Entity
  3. Scenario
  4. Version
  5. Period
  6. Years
  7. Currency

* **Up to 7 custom dimensions**, for a **total of 14 dimensions** in your Planning cube (per plan type / cube).

---

### ðŸ§  Important Clarifications:

* **Yes**, Custom Planning supports **7 custom dimensions** (not 14 customâ€”14 total including the 7 required).
* This applies **per BSO cube** (Plan Type).
* You can add **multiple Plan Types (cubes)** in a Custom Planning app, and each one can have its own 7 custom dimensions (they donâ€™t need to be the same across cubes).
* This option is **only available in Enterprise EPM Cloud**.

---

### ðŸš« What Happens in Module-Based Apps (e.g., Financials, Workforce)

* Those modules come **preconfigured** with only **3 custom dimensions**, and that limit **cannot be increased**.
* Even in Enterprise, module cubes are restricted because Oracle has locked down the dimensionality for those use cases.

---

### âœ… Bottom Line

| App Type                               | Max Custom Dimensions | Total Dimensions (incl. required) |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Custom Planning (Enterprise)**       | **7**                 | **14**                            |
| **Module-based Planning (Enterprise)** | **3**                 | **10**                            |
| **Standard Edition**                   | **3**                 | **10**                            |
